# About

I am a graduate student in the [Chemical Engineering Department at Columbia University](https://cheme.columbia.edu/) working in the [Electrochemical Enginering Lab](https://electrochem-lab.cheme.columbia.edu/). My research is in augmenting mathematical models with statistics to better understand physical phenomena limiting batteries.
