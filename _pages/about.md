I'm a graduate student in the [Chemical Engineering Department at Columbia University](https://cheme.columbia.edu/) working in the [Electrochemical Enginering Lab](https://electrochem-lab.cheme.columbia.edu/). My research involves augmenting mathematical models with statistics to better understand the physical phenomena limiting performance of electrochemical systems. I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2018.
